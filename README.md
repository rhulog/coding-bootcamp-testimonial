## My process
I've been learning jQuery recently so incorporated that into the making of this one. The slider toggle took a bit to figure out in Javascript but the jQuery cut down the lines of code by more than a half.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery - (https://jquery.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

The slider animation took me a long while to figure out. It was one of those moments where I struggled against the idea for a good day and came up with nothing, and the day after the light went off to use the toggle function in jQuery would solve my problem. It wa smooth sailing from there.
